# 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap

In this project, I will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer

Here the final result:
